    "## Ingestion\n",
    "The process begins with collecting the raw data sources.\n",
    "In a Pasteur project, raw data sources are stored in the `./raw` directory by default,\n",
    "but you can change this to ex. an S3 share or a different drive mount, in case it\n",
    "is large.\n",
    "The `./raw` data directory is considered immutable by Pasteur, and can contain\n",
    "archives (`.zip`, `.tar`), SQL dumps, CSV files, JSON files or any type of file\n",
    "in its raw form.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Raw Data sources are then combined and preprocessed to form a `Dataset`.\n",
    "This is done by a `Dataset` module, which contains all relevant information\n",
    "required to wrangle the raw sources into a tidy form (by typing, removing unnecessary \n",
    "data, and renaming columns to adhere to project standards).\n",
    "Currently, only multi-table tabular data is supported, but in the future\n",
    "Pasteur should also support multi-modal data such as images, time-series, and\n",
    "audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets represent the raw data sources in full resolution.\n",
    "With few exceptions, this will mean that it is intractable to synthesize them\n",
    "as is.\n",
    "We therefore need to downsample Datasets into a more manageable form.\n",
    "We name this form a `View`.\n",
    "`View` modules have an API similar to datasets and work in a similar process.\n",
    "However, since the bulk of processing and typing is performed on the `Dataset`\n",
    "level, `View` modules are used to select subsets of tables, rows, and columns from\n",
    "the original `Dataset`, or simplify columns to a smaller domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ingestion stage ends with the preprocessed `View` data.\n",
    "We associate a set of hyperparameters with this `View` data, that can be used\n",
    "to transform and encode for synthesis, as well as for evaluation."

    "## Synthesis\n",
    "The next stage to data synthesis is synthesis itself.\n",
    "Pasteur does not dictate a particular procedure for synthesis, other than\n",
    "splitting the procedure into three stages (`bake`, `fit`, and `sample`), leaving the rest up\n",
    "to the algorithm creator.\n",
    "Pasteur does define a formalized procedure for encoding data and integrating domain\n",
    "knowledge, which is a significant and complex task on its own.\n",
    "Pasteur separates the encoding process into two reversible steps: Transformation, and Encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Transformation, complex types (such as dates) are broken down into simpler\n",
    "ones (numerical, categorical values) with a formalized specification (Base Transform Layer).\n",
    "This process is performed by modules named Transformers, each of which is designed\n",
    "to handle a single column type.\n",
    "Transformers integrate expert domain knowledge into their column transformations,\n",
    "and the end result is simpler types with orthogonal information.\n",
    "E.g., consider two date columns we know to be relative: `21-3-23`, `25-3-23`, they both\n",
    "contain denormalized information about the year.\n",
    "With a naive transformation it would be left up to the synthesis algorithm to\n",
    "enforce the denormalized dates (years, months) match.\n",
    "However, we can transform those two dates into: `2023`, `March`, `23`, `4 days`,\n",
    "in which case the information held by each column has been normalized (no duplication).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Encoding, the simpler column types are converted to a form suitable for the\n",
    "synthesis algorithm and metric at hand.\n",
    "A synthesis execution can require multiple encodings.\n",
    "For Neural Network algorithms, the Base Transform Layer would be converted\n",
    "into vector batches (e.g., float16/32 vectors, one-hot).\n",
    "For Marginal Algorithms, the numerical columns would be discretized into bins.\n",

    "access patterns.\n",
    "Metrics are split based on how they access data into `Column`, `Table`, and `View` metrics.\n",
    "This influences how metrics are instantiated in a synthesis execution: \n",
