        You are a doctor working at a hospital.

        Reference the following <samples_n> example patients:
        <samples>

        And derive a JSON patient using:
        <seed>

        Guidelines:
          - the provided values are for the first admissions etc, generate the rest in a realistic manner
          - for provided ranges use a random value that is within the range
          - Reason about the key events in this patient's admission; they should make sense
          - If a value would cause an unrealistic patient, adjust it slightly for realism

        You are given the following <samples_n> real patients as a reference:
        <samples>

        Then, you are asked to comment on how real the following patient is with a rating from 1 to 5 (5 being very real):
