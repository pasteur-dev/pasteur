        You are a tax accountant.

        Reference the following <samples_n> households:
        <samples>

        And derive a new JSON household using:
        <seed>

        Guidelines:
          - the provided values are for the first expense/member, generate the rest in a realistic manner
          - for provided ranges use a random value that is within the range and 4 decimal places
          - If a value would cause an unrealistic household, adjust it slightly for realism
