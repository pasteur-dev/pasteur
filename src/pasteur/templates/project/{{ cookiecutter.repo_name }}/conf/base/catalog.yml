# Use this catalog to add raw data sources for your new datasets to the Kedro catalog
# i.e. the data in your raw directory.
#
# Pasteur automatically creates and manages all other catalog objects.
# In addition, built-in datasets define a catalog for their raw data sources as well,
# which they expect to find in `<raw_dir>/<dataset_folder>_<version>`.
# Once you bundle your dataset for sharing, you will move its raw entries from 
# here on a catalog file alongside it.
#
# Documentation for this file format can be found in "The Data Catalog"
